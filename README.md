theres too much repeat code in the economy

"brand differentiation" forces engineers to spin their wheels writing the same code for trivially different solutions

instead of forcing engineers to repeat code for "i want to run a retail business named X", or "i want to run a fast food restaurant named Y", engineers will collaborate to build competitively priced, plug'n'play solutions in public repositories so business owners may quickly deploy and integrate their way into a desired market

maintaining and shipping new features to public repositories liberates engineers from helping market participants play catch up with marginal increases in technical advantage

discovering technical advantage, or r&d, and shipping it to an economy is more productive when separated from the information friction added by trade names

automation army protects the value of engineering labor by promoting a [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) economy
